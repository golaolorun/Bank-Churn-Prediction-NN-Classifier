# Bank-Churn-Prediction-Neural-Network-Classifier
Data Science project using Neural Network Classifier
- by: _Gbenga Olaolorun_

## Description
This project aims to build a neural network-based classifier to predict whether bank customers are likely to leave (churn) within the next six months. By understanding the factors influencing churn, the bank can improve its services and retention strategies, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Background and Context
Businesses like banks face the challenge of customer churn, where customers leave for competing service providers. Understanding the reasons behind churn is crucial for management to focus on improving services based on customer priorities. This project utilizes data-driven insights to help the bank retain its customer base.

## Data Dictionary
This case study uses an open-source dataset from Kaggle, containing 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features. The dataset includes:

-  CustomerId: Unique identifier assigned to each customer
-  Surname: Last name of the customer
-  CreditScore: A measure of the customer's credit history
-  Geography: Location of the customer
-  Gender: Gender of the customer
-  Age: Age of the customer
-  Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank
-  NumOfProducts: Number of products purchased by the customer through the bank
-  Balance: Account balance of the customer
-  HasCrCard: Indicates if the customer has a credit card (1 for yes, 0 for no)
-  EstimatedSalary: Estimated annual salary of the customer
-  isActiveMember: Indicates if the customer is an active member of the bank (1 for yes, 0 for no)
-  Exited: Indicates whether the customer left the bank within six months (1 for yes, 0 for no)

## Objective
-  Build a neural network classifier to predict customer churn within six months.
-  Identify key features that influence a customer's decision to leave.
-  Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

## Results
- The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score after training.

## Acknowledgements
- My Great Learning for providing the dataset and the problem statement.
